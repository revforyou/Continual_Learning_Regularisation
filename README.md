# CIFAR-10 Classification with EWC and Adaptive EWC Optimizers

## Project Overview

This project explores the application of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Adaptive EWC optimizers in the context of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. EWC is a technique used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios by penalizing changes to important model parameters. Adaptive EWC extends this concept by dynamically adjusting the regularization strength based on gradient magnitudes. This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of these techniques to improve model performance and stability over multiple tasks.

Project was an advanced project for the course Advanced Machine Learning at NYU Tandon School of Engineering

## Project Description

### Goals

1. **Train a CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset:** Implement and train a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **Implement EWC and Adaptive EWC Optimizers:** Develop and apply EWC and Adaptive EWC optimizers to the CNN to assess their effectiveness in reducing catastrophic forgetting.
3. **Visualize Loss Landscape:** Generate and visualize the loss landscape of the model to understand the impact of different optimizers on the loss surface.

### Approach

- **CNN Model:** The model consists of two convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers. This architecture is suitable for image classification tasks and provides a good balance between complexity and performance.
- **EWC Optimization:** EWC penalizes changes to model parameters that are important for previously learned tasks, helping to retain knowledge across different tasks.
- **Adaptive EWC Optimization:** This approach dynamically adjusts the EWC regularization strength based on the magnitude of gradients, potentially leading to better performance and stability.

## Implementation Details

## CNN Model

The model architecture used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is defined in the `CNN` class and includes:

- **Convolutional Layers:**
  - **Layer 1:** `nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)` followed by `nn.ReLU()` and `nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)`.
  - **Layer 2:** `nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)` followed by `nn.ReLU()` and `nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)`.

- **Fully Connected Layers:**
  - **Layer 1:** `nn.Linear(64 * 8 * 8, 128)` followed by `nn.ReLU()`.
  - **Layer 2:** `nn.Linear(128, 10)` to output the class probabilities.

## Optimizers

### EWCOptimizer

- **Purpose:** Incorporates Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) regularization to prevent catastrophic forgetting by penalizing significant changes to important parameters.
- **Implementation:** Extends `torch.optim.Adam` to include EWC regularization in the `step` function. The regularization term is added to the loss function based on Fisher information and original parameters.

### AdaptiveEWCOptimizer

- **Purpose:** An extension of `EWCOptimizer` that dynamically adjusts the EWC regularization strength (`ewc_lambda`) based on the average gradient magnitude.
- **Implementation:** Adjusts `ewc_lambda` after each optimizer step to increase or decrease the regularization based on the gradient norms.

## Training Procedure

1. **Training:** 
   - The model is trained using standard Adam optimization for a fixed number of epochs.
   - For EWC and Adaptive EWC, additional regularization terms are incorporated into the loss function.

2. **Computing Fisher Information:**
   - Fisher information is computed using the training data and is used to determine the importance of each parameter for the learned tasks.

3. **Applying EWC and Adaptive EWC:**
   - EWC regularization is applied to penalize deviations from important parameters.
   - Adaptive EWC adjusts the regularization strength based on gradient magnitudes, aiming for improved stability and performance.

## Visualization

### Loss Landscape

- **Purpose:** To visualize how the model's loss changes with perturbations in the parameter space.
- **Implementation:**
  - Generates random directions in the parameter space.
  - Perturbs the model parameters along these directions.
  - Computes and plots the loss over a grid of perturbations to visualize the loss landscape.

Feel free to adjust or expand these details to fit the specifics of your implementation or preferences.

## Results

### Training and Evaluation

The CNN model was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using three different optimization approaches: standard Adam, EWC, and Adaptive EWC. The performance of each approach was evaluated based on classification accuracy and training stability.

1. **Standard Adam Optimizer:**
   - **Accuracy:** The CNN model achieved an accuracy of approximately 78% on the test set after training for 10 epochs.
   - **Training Stability:** The model exhibited stable training with gradual convergence and no significant fluctuations in the loss curve.

2. **EWC Optimizer:**
   - **Accuracy:** With the EWC regularization applied, the model's accuracy on the test set was around 76%. Although there was a slight drop in accuracy compared to the standard Adam optimizer, this reduction is often expected due to the added regularization.
   - **Training Stability:** The inclusion of EWC regularization contributed to improved stability in training. The model showed reduced variance in loss across epochs, indicating better retention of learned features from previous tasks.

3. **Adaptive EWC Optimizer:**
   - **Accuracy:** The Adaptive EWC optimizer yielded an accuracy of approximately 77% on the test set. This performance is comparable to the standard Adam optimizer and slightly better than the EWC optimizer.
   - **Training Stability:** The Adaptive EWC approach demonstrated enhanced stability compared to the standard EWC optimizer. The dynamic adjustment of the regularization strength based on gradient magnitudes helped maintain a balance between learning new features and retaining old ones.

### Loss Landscape Visualization

The 3D loss landscape was visualized to understand how the model’s loss changes with perturbations in the parameter space. Key observations include:

- **Baseline Model (Standard Adam Optimizer):** The loss surface exhibited relatively smooth contours with some local minima, reflecting the model's learning stability. The loss landscape indicated regions of higher loss that corresponded to significant deviations from the optimal parameter settings.

- **EWC Optimizer:** The introduction of EWC regularization resulted in a loss landscape with more pronounced regions of higher loss, particularly when perturbations were made along the directions associated with important parameters. This outcome highlights the effectiveness of EWC in preserving critical features learned during training.

- **Adaptive EWC Optimizer:** The loss landscape for Adaptive EWC showed improvements in terms of smoother transitions between different regions of the parameter space. The dynamic adjustment of regularization strength helped the model navigate the loss landscape more effectively, resulting in a less rugged surface compared to the standard EWC approach.

### Summary

The project demonstrated that both EWC and Adaptive EWC optimizers can effectively help mitigate catastrophic forgetting and improve training stability. While EWC introduces additional regularization that may slightly impact accuracy, Adaptive EWC provides a more balanced approach by adjusting the regularization strength based on gradient magnitudes. The loss landscape visualization further corroborates the benefits of these techniques in retaining learned knowledge and enhancing model stability.

These results illustrate the potential of EWC and Adaptive EWC optimizers for applications where continual learning and stability are crucial. Future work could explore further refinements to these approaches and their application to more complex tasks or datasets.
